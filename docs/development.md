# Development

Supplemental development notes.

## Codeveloping Dependencies

It's often useful to codevelop dependencies by linking them because it doesn't
require publishing. The workflow is usually:

1. `npm install` (if not already done).
2. `npm link <local dep1> <local dep2> <local dep3>...` (must specify all
   linkage in one command). @devvit/previews is required. Verify symbolic links
   to your local folders with `ls -l node_modules/@devvit`.
3. `npm start` development server.
4. Edit and build dependencies as needed.
5. Cleanup; unlink all play dependencies by re-running `npm install`.
   `npm link --save` if you want links to persist past install.

## Bundle Size

All JavaScript and CSS build product gzipped sizes are tracked and tested with
[bundlesize](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize). Keep the threshold
(configured in package.json) just above the actual size so that it's easy to
track commit cost.

The contents of each bundle generated can be evaluated through its source map.
[source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer) and
[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) can be used
to generate reports for bundle breakdowns.

## Ignoring OS Cache Files

Unwanted environment-specific files such as `.DS_Store` and `Thumbs.db` should
be excluded by the user's global Git configuration. They're unwanted in every
repository and not specific to play. See
[gitignore documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) for details.

1. Add a global exclusions file by executing
   `git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore'` or updating your
   `~/.gitconfig` manually:

```gitconfig
excludesfile = ~/.gitignore
```

2. Always ignore `.DS_Store` files by executing `echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore`
   or updating your `~/.gitignore` manually:

```gitignore
.DS_Store
```
